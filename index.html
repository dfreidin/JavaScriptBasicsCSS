                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browseer or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a>Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffy, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="examples">var x;</span></li>
                    <li><a>Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a vaalue to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="examples">var x = 10;</span></li>
                    <li><a>Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="examples">true</span> or <span class="examples">false;</span> null - <span class="examples">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="examples">42</span> or <span class="examples">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="Examples">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="examples">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="examples">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                    <li><a>Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You cn use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="examples">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="examples">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="examples">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><a>Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, whell you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><a>Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over an over an over again.</li>
